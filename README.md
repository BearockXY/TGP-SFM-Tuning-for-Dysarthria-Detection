# Use-TGP-for-tuning-Speech-Fundation-Model-for-Dyasarthria-Speech-Detection
This repo is to post the implementation for the Interspeech 2025 paper: Mitigating Overfitting During Speech Foundation Model Fine-tuning: Applications to Dysarthric Speech Detection. Authors: Yan Xiong, Visar Berisha, Julie Liss, and Chaitali Chakrabarti.

It is all the Python scripts used to run experiments for the paper. It is recommended to start with the bash script to understand how the implementaion runs.

The model is too large to be included. Please feel free to mail the author for the pre-trained model if needed.
