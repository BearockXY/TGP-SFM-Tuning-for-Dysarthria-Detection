# Use-TGP-for-tuning-Speech-Fundation-Model-for-Dyasarthria-Speech-Detection
This repo is to post the implementation for Interspeech 2025 paper: Mitigating Overfitting During Speech Foundation Model Fine-tuning: Applications to Dysarthric Speech Detection. Authors: Yan Xiong, Visar Berisha, Julie Liss and Chaitali Chakrabarti.
It is all the python scripts used to run experiments for the paper. The model is too large to be included. Please feel free to mail author for pre-trained model if needed.
